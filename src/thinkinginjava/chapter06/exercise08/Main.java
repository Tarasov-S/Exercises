 * Chapter 6. Exercise 8. Difficult - 4/10.
 *
 * Following the form of the example Lunch.java, create a class called ConnectionManager
 * that manages a fixed array of Connection objects.
 * The client programmer must not be able to explicitly create Connection objects,
 * but can only get them via a static method in ConnectionManager.
 * When the ConnectionManager runs out of objects, it returns a null reference. Test the classes in main( ).
