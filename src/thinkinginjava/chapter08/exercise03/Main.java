 * Chapter 8. Exercise 3. Difficult - 1/10.
 *
 * Add a new method in the base class of Shapes.java that prints a message,
 * but donâ€™t override it in the derived classes. Explain what happens.
 * Now override it in one of the derived classes but not the others, and see what happens.
 * Finally, override it in all the derived classes.
